# LettX
Code and data accompanying MSI and HSI nutrient estimation projects.

## MSI Code is meant to be used to 
1. Detect anomalous growth trajectories using vegetation indices
2. Estimate tissue nutrient concentrations using either Random Forest or Vision Transformer state estimation modules

## HSI Code is meant for hyperspectral tissue nutrient estimation
Models include:
1. ResNet architectures (ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101)
2. Vision Transformer architecture (ViT)
