# LettX
Code and data accompanying MSI and HSI nutrient estimation projects.

## MSI Code is meant for tissue nutrient estimation from multispectral images 
1. Detect anomalous growth trajectories using vegetation indices
2. Estimate tissue nutrient concentrations using either Random Forest or Vision Transformer state estimation modules

## HSI Code is meant for tissue nutrient estimation from hyperspectral images
Models include:
1. ResNet architectures (ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101)
2. Vision Transformer architecture (ViT)
